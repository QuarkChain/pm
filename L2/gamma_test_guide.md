# Gamma Test Guide

The Gamma Testnet has launched, and we encourage every team member to test all aspects of the network. This guide outlines key areas to focus on and provides clear instructions to facilitate the testing

## Recommended Tests for All Team Members
 - **Full Node Synchronization**: folow [these instructions](https://github.com/QuarkChain/pm/blob/main/L2/gamma_testnet_new_node.md) to set up and synchronize a full node or an archive node.
 - **Token Migration and Bridge Functionality**: Refer to this [link](https://github.com/QuarkChain/pm/blob/main/L2/gamma_testnet_usage.md) to perform token migration and test the ERC20 bridge functionalities.
 - **Website Upload via ethfs-cli** Once you have acquired gas tokens on L2, upload a website using the [ethfs-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethfs-cli) tool, and verify the uploaded site through our gateway.
 - **Test EIP-7702 Features**: Evaluate and test EIP-7702 capabilities within the Gamma Testnet environment.
 
## Additional Tests for Mingpeng
 - **Website Deployment**: Deploy both ethstorage.io and web3url.io onto the Gamma Testnet to confirm compatibility and functionality.
 - **Uniswap Application Deployment**: Set up a Uniswap on the Gamma Testnet, ensuring DApp functionality and stability.
 - **Stress Testing**: Conduct stress test through scenarios such as token airdrops.
